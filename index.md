We propose the exploration of new theory and algorithms for quantum system characterization. Recent advances, based on non-convex optimization and learning protocols, have led to higher efficiency than typical solutions, while being rigorously justified in theory. However, with more qubits, the volume of gen- erated data outgrows our computational capacity even for these methods, posing major challenges. The goal of this project is to close this gap, by investigating ways to accelerate such protocols, with guarantees.

In this proposal, we are concerned with optimizing the information extraction from quantum systems. While quantum computing has not yet demonstrated provable supremacy in most ap- plication areas, experiments using real quantum information processors are being performed right now. Thus, our proposal is not some abstraction. This project focuses on benchmarking and testing quantum computation systems, through efficient, robust and provable quantum state tomography, as well as novel noise-robust validation and certification tools for quantum computing. This research proposes to inves- tigate new theoretical and practical approaches, via the following three paths: i) by provably distributing computations in a non-convex way for large-scale quantum state tomography, ii) by robustifying state of the art vali- dation methods using robust optimization and techniques, and finally, iii) by designing efficient and robust schemes for validating and certifying specific experimentally-relevant quantum operations. We propose to evaluate the the- oretical studies with experiments on available prototypes of quantum processors, in order to assess their practicality in real scenaria.

1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
